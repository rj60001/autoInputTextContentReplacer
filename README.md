# autoInputTextContentReplacer
This is a tiny script that clears and restores a default value for an input in HTML.
## Requirements
* Set an info attribute and value attribute in the target element.
* Set the info attribute to the same value as the info element.
* Call with *onfocus* for **clearValue()** and *onblur* for **restoreValue()**.

If you have any problems please open a new issue.
